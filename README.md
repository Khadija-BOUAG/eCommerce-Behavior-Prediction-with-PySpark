# eCommerce-Behavior-Prediction-with-PySpark

## Abstract

Detecting eCommerce behavior is a challenge that must be taken
seriously on a financial level.

To be successful, ecommerce companies need to understand new
trends in consumer shopping behavior. Indeed, what drives customers is
different than it was, thus, it was necessary to think through the
entire end-to-end ecommerce shopping experience using ML
techniques.

The objective of this work is to develop an application for detecting
eCommerce behavior using the Apache Spark MLlib library, then
compare the different algorithms. We used a dataset containing 285
million users' events from an eCommerce website. We worked on four
algorithms : Logistic Regression,Decision Tree, Random Forest,
Gradient-Boosted Tree and Naive-Bayes.

Performance analysis proved that the first three algorithms are
the best among these ones.

## Working with Big Data Technologies - Apache Spark

In order to simplify our approach, we have worked on a
supervised learning problem and with
data whose variable to be predicted “event_type” is labeled
in purchase or cart or view.

The work is done in Apache Spark using the MLlib library
of
the Pyspark API using the Python programming language.


Apache Spark is a dedicated fast data processing engine
to
BigData.

It allows to process large volumes of data
in a distributed way. Apache Spark was developed as a
faster alternative to Hadoop, Hadoop-MapReduce reads and writes
data from disk, which slows processing speed.

Apache Spark stores this data in memory which allows
reduce the read/write cycle. Spark was developed in Scala
and offers APIs for Java, Python and R. Its architecture
distributed allows to execute the learning algorithms
automatic faster without compromising
their performance.
